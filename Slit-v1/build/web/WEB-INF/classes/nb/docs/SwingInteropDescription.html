<h1 align="">Swing Interop Sample Description</h1>
<p>

This project demonstrates the use of JavaFX 2.0 components in a Swing based application. </p>

<br>

<h2>JavaFX2-in-Swing in NetBeans 7.1</h2>
<p>Building the sample SwingInterop produces in project <code>dist/</code> subdirectory
a JAR file, a HTML file and two JNLP files - one to enable standalone
application launch, the other to enable launch as applet within the HTML page.
Note that the application is not a JavaFX 2.0 application and
the built files do not follow the JavaFX 2.0 deployment
model as described at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx">JavaFX website</a>. The JNLP files
are pre-FX WebStart files, extended only by the reference to the
required JavaFX 2.0+ runtime, which must be present in the system
in order to run the application. The application itself launches
either as standard Swing application or as (pre-FX) applet.
To run the sample outside of NetBeans IDE do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>java -jar SwingInterop.jar</li>
    <li>double-click SwingInterop_application.jnlp</li>
    <li>open SwingInterop.html in a browser with installed JavaFX plug-in</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating JavaFX2-in-Swing projects</h2>
<p>NetBeans 7.1 supports either pure Java2SE (Swing) projects or pure
JavaFX 2.0+ projects, but does not provide specific support for
JavaFX2-in-Swing projects. Such support will be included in NetBeans 7.2.
Before NetBeans 7.2 is available, the following workarounds can be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use SwingInterop sample as starting point and modify its contents
    as required. Note that the <code>main.class</code> property must be updated
   manually in <code>nbproject/project.properties</code> to point to the main class of
   your modified project.</li>
<li>To start from scratch, create a new JavaFX Preloader project (in menu
    File->New Project->JavaFX->JavaFX Preloader). Replace <code>build.xml</code> by
    <code>build.xml</code> taken from the SwingInterop sample (and preferably edit 
    &lt;project&gt; name in it). Copy the whole <code>web/</code> subdirectory from
   SwingInterop sample to the new project. In <code>nbproject/project.properties</code>
   add manually the property <code>main.class</code> and set it to the true
   main class name when your java sources are ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Use Run to run the application within the IDE.<br>
Use Clean and Build to obtain the deployment files as described above.</p>
